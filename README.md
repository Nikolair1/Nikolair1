Hi, I’m Nikolai Ramalingam or Nicky for short  and I’m interested in learning more about software development.
I study Computer Science & Engineering at UCLA and I like surfing in my freetime. I have uploaded different projects that I've
done in the past and hope to use GitHub more for future projects as well.

Feel free to contact me at nikolairamalingam@gmail.com & my LinkedIn is https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolai-ramalingam-0547ba224/
